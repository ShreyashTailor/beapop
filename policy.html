          Privacy Policy
          Last updated: March 17, 2023

          This Privacy Policy applies to Beap services (the “Platform”), which include Beap apps, websites, software and
          related services accessed via any platform or device that link to this Privacy Policy. The Platform is
          provided and controlled by Beap Inc. (“Beap”, “we” or “us”). We are committed to protecting and respecting
          your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share, and otherwise process the personal
          information of users and other individuals age 13 and over in connection with our Platform. For information
          about how we collect, use, share, and otherwise process the personal information of users under age 13
          (“Children”), please refer to our Children’s Privacy Policy.

          Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given to them in the Terms of
          Service.

          What Information We Collect
          We may collect information from and about you, including information that you provide, information from other
          sources, and automatically collected information.

          Information You Provide
          When you create an account, upload content, contact us directly, or otherwise use the Platform, you may
          provide some or all of the following information:

          Account and profile information, such as name, age, username, password, language, email, phone number, social
          media account information, and profile image.
          User-generated content, including comments, photographs, livestreams, audio recordings, videos, text,
          hashtags, and virtual item videos that you choose to create with or upload to the Platform (“User Content”)
          and the associated metadata, such as when, where, and by whom the content was created. Even if you are not a
          user, information about you may appear in User Content created or published by users on the Platform. When you
          create User Content, we may upload or import it to the Platform before you save or post the User Content (also
          known as pre-uploading), for example, in order to recommend audio options, generate captions, and provide
          other personalized recommendations. If you apply an effect to your User Content, we may collect a version of
          your User Content that does not include the effect.
          Messages, which include information you provide when you compose, send, or receive messages through the
          Platform’s messaging functionalities. They include messages you send through our chat functionality when
          communicating with merchants who sell goods to you, and your use of virtual assistants when purchasing items
          through the Platform. That information includes the content of the message and information about the message,
          such as when it was sent, received, or read, and message participants. Please be aware that messages you
          choose to send to other users of the Platform will be accessible by those users and that we are not
          responsible for the manner in which those users use or share the messages.
          Information, including text, images, and videos, found in your device’s clipboard, with your permission. For
          example, if you choose to initiate information sharing with a third-party platform, or choose to paste content
          from the clipboard onto the Platform, we access this information stored in your clipboard in order to fulfill
          your request.
          Purchase information, including payment card numbers or other third-party payment information (such as PayPal)
          where required for the purpose of payment, and billing and shipping address. We also collect information that
          is required for extended warranty purposes and your transaction and purchase history on or through the
          Platform.
          Your phone and social network contacts, with your permission. If you choose to find other users through your
          phone contacts, we will access and collect information such as names, phone numbers, and email addresses, and
          match that information against existing users of the Platform. If you choose to find other users through your
          social network contacts, we will collect your public profile information as well as names and profiles of your
          social network contacts.
          Your choices and communication preferences.
          Information to verify an account such as proof of identity or age.
          Information in correspondence you send to us, including when you contact us for support.
          Information you share through surveys or your participation in challenges, research, promotions, marketing
          campaigns, events, or contests such as your gender, age, likeness, and preferences.
          Information From Other Sources
          We may receive the information described in this Privacy Policy from other sources, such as:

          If you choose to sign-up or log-in to the Platform using a third-party service such as Facebook, Twitter,
          Instagram, or Google, or link your Beap account to a third-party service, we may collect information from the
          service–for example, your public profile information (such as nickname), email, and contact list.
          Advertisers, measurement and other partners share information with us about you and the actions you have taken
          outside of the Platform, such as your activities on other websites and apps or in stores, including the
          products or services you purchased, online or in person. These partners also share information with us, such
          as mobile identifiers for advertising, hashed email addresses and phone numbers, and cookie identifiers, which
          we use to help match you and your actions outside of the Platform with your Beap account.
