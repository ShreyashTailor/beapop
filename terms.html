          Terms of Service
          Last updated: March 2023

          (If you are a user having your usual residence in the US)

          Your Relationship With Us
          Welcome to Beap (the “Platform”), which is provided by Beap Inc. in the United States (collectively such
          entities will be referred to as “Beap”, “we” or “us”).
          You are reading the terms of service (the “Terms”), which govern the relationship and serve as an agreement
          between you and us and set forth the terms and conditions by which you may access and use the Platform and our
          related websites, services, applications, products, and content (collectively, the “Services”). Access to
          certain Services or features of the Services (such as, by way of example and not limitation, the ability to
          submit or share User Content (defined below)) may be subject to age restrictions and not available to all
          users of the Services. Our Services are provided for private, non-commercial use. For purposes of these Terms,
          “you” and “your” means you as the user of the Services.

          The Terms form a legally binding agreement between you and us. Please take the time to read them carefully. If
          you are under age 18, you may only use the Services with the consent of your parent or legal guardian. Please
          be sure your parent or legal guardian has reviewed and discussed these Terms with you.

          Accepting the Terms
          By accessing or using our Services, you confirm that you can form a binding contract with Beap, that you
          accept these Terms, and that you agree to comply with them. Your access to and use of our Services is also
          subject to our Privacy Policy and Community Guidelines, the terms of which can be found directly on the
          Platform, or where the Platform is made available for download, on your mobile device’s applicable app store,
          and are incorporated herein by reference. By using the Services, you consent to the terms of the Privacy
          Policy.
          If you are accessing or using the Services on behalf of a business or entity, then (a) “you” and “your”
          includes you and that business or entity, (b) you represent and warrant that you are an authorized
          representative of the business or entity with the authority to bind the entity to these Terms, and that you
          agree to these Terms on the entity’s behalf, and (c) your business or entity is legally and financially
          responsible for your access or use of the Services as well as for the access or use of your account by others
          affiliated with your entity, including any employees, agents or contractors.

          You can accept the Terms by accessing or using our Services. You understand and agree that we will treat your
          access or use of the Services as acceptance of the Terms from that point onwards.

          You should print off or save a local copy of the Terms for your records.

          Changes to the Terms
          We amend these Terms from time to time, for instance, when we update the functionality of our Services, when
          we combine multiple apps or services operated by us or our affiliates into a single combined service or app,
          or when there are regulatory changes. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to generally notify all
          users of any material changes to these Terms, such as through a notice on our Platform, however, you should
          look at the Terms regularly to check for such changes. We will also update the “Last Updated” date at the top
          of these Terms, which reflects the effective date of such Terms. Your continued access or use of the Services
          after the date of the new Terms constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms. If you do not agree to the new
          Terms, you must stop accessing or using the Services.

          Your Account with Us
          To access or use some of our Services, you must create an account with us. When you create this account, you
          must provide accurate and up-to-date information. It is important that you maintain and promptly update your
          details and any other information you provide to us, to keep such information current and complete.

          It is important that you keep your account password confidential and that you do not disclose it to any third
          party. If you know or suspect that any third party knows your password or has accessed your account, you must
          notify us immediately at: <a href="https://dsc.gg/teamop1969">DISCORD</a>.

          You agree that you are solely responsible (to us and to others) for the activity that occurs under your
          account.

          We reserve the right to disable your user account at any time, including if you have failed to comply with any
          of the provisions of these Terms, or if activities occur on your account which, in our sole discretion, would
          or might cause damage to or impair the Services or infringe or violate any third party rights, or violate any
          applicable laws or regulations.

          If you no longer want to use our Services again, and would like your account deleted, contact us at:
          <a href="https://dsc.gg/teamop1969"> DISCORD</a>. We will provide you with further assistance and guide you through
          the process. Once you choose to delete your account, you will not be able to reactivate.
